I wanna be with you
Gotta be with you
Need to be with you
Oh oh oh oh
I wanna be with you
Gotta be with you
Need to be with you
Oh oh oh oh
Oooo oh oh oh oh
Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn’t build nothin’ overnight
Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase said we can’t see that
Now from top to bottom they see that we did that
Yes it’s so true that
Yes we been through it
Yes we got real shit
Yes see baby we've been
Too strong for too long
And I can’t be without you baby
And I’ll be waitin’ up until you get home
Cause I can’t sleep without you baby
If anybody who’s ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it nothin’ can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby
