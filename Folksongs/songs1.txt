Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it
