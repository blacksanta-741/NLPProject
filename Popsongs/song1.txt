Another night another dream but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
Just another night another vision of love
You feel joy you feel pain Cause nothing will be the same
Just another night is all that it takes
To understand the difference between lovers and fakes
So baby I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true
I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true
In the night in my dreams
I'm in love with you Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy I feel pain Cause it's still the same
When the night is gone I'll be alone
Another night another dream but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
